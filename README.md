## 🚀 Overview

MesaChain revolutionizes the restaurant and café industry by seamlessly integrating comprehensive management tools with the Stellar blockchain. Our platform addresses critical challenges facing food service establishments while leveraging blockchain technology to reduce costs and enhance customer experiences.

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

The restaurant industry currently faces multiple pain points that impact profitability and growth:

- 💸 High payment processing fees (2-4% per transaction)
- 🧩 Fragmented management systems (inventory, staff, sales)
- 🎁 Ineffective and costly loyalty programs
- ⏱️ Slow financial processes (settlements, payments to employees/suppliers)
- 📊 Limited data visibility for decision-making

## 👥 Target Users

- 🍕 Independent restaurant, bar, and café owners and managers
- 🏢 Medium-sized establishment chains (5-50 locations)
- 👨‍🍳 Service staff (waiters, cashiers, chefs)
- 🧑‍💼 Frequent customers of these establishments
- 🚚 Suppliers for the food service sector

## 🌍 Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Stellar Network Configuration
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet  # Options: testnet | mainnet
HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org  # Testnet URL
API_BASE_URL_BACKEND=http://localhost:3000
API_BASE_URL_FRONTEND=http://localhost:5173
```

For the frontend, create a `.env` file in the `apps/frontend` directory with the same variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_BACKEND=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_FRONTEND=http://localhost:5173
```

### Environment Variable Validation

The application uses Zod for environment variable validation. Missing or malformed variables will cause the application to fail fast with descriptive error messages.

### Switching Between Networks

To switch between testnet and mainnet:

1. Update `STELLAR_NETWORK` to either `testnet` or `mainnet`
2. Update `HORIZON_URL` accordingly:
   - Testnet: `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org`
   - Mainnet: `https://horizon.stellar.org`

### Security Notes

- Never commit real `.env` files to version control
- Store production secrets in GitHub Secrets & Variables
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required variables

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Frontend (FE)

To run the frontend application:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd MesaChain-FE

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

### Backend (BE)

To run the backend application:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd MesaChain-BE

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:4000 by default.

### Running Both Frontend and Backend

For full application functionality, you'll need both services running. Open two terminal windows and follow these steps:

Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
cd MesaChain-BE
pnpm run dev
```

Terminal 2 (Frontend):
```bash
cd MesaChain-FE
pnpm run dev
```

Make sure you have all the required environment variables set up as described in the Environment Setup section above.

## Start DB


## 🚀 Development Workflow

After the initial setup, you can use the following commands for development:

- `npm run dev` - Start the application in development mode with hot reloading
- `npm run test` - Run the test suite
- `npm run lint` - Run the linter to check code quality

## ❓ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any dependency issues, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, then run `pnpm install` again.

Make sure you have the correct versions of Node.js and pnpm installed.

Check the project documentation for any specific environment variables that need to be set.

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

MesaChain uses Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack for comprehensive monitoring and centralized logging. See `MONITORING.md` for full onboarding and playbook details.
